 P2 Custom Libraries for Propeller

Libraries are documented with doxygen and so in the html folder open index.html to see a list of libraries and discriptions.

To use these libraries with flexprop download them and put them in a custom folder on your computer.
Then go into flexprop and add the library to the library search path.
For example I put mine into d:\custom.  So in flex prop I added d:\custom as a library path.

There is a folder labeled libSample which contains test code used to test each library with.  You can copy this folder to where ever you have your flex prop source code.
